# üîÑ Streamlit Inactivity Solutions

## Why Does Streamlit Become Inactive?

Streamlit apps can become inactive due to several reasons:

1. **Streamlit Cloud Free Tier Limitations**
   - Apps "sleep" after 7 days of inactivity
   - Limited resources for idle apps
   - Session timeouts after prolonged inactivity

2. **Browser/Network Issues**
   - WebSocket connection drops
   - Browser tab inactive for too long
   - Network interruptions

3. **Long-Running Operations**
   - Scans taking too long
   - Memory/timeout limits reached
   - No progress updates to keep session alive

## ‚úÖ Solutions Implemented

### 1. Streamlit Configuration (`.streamlit/config.toml`)
We've created a configuration file that:
- ‚úÖ Enables proper server settings
- ‚úÖ Configures websocket compression
- ‚úÖ Enforces serial reruns to prevent freezing
- ‚úÖ Shows error details for debugging

### 2. Code-Level Solutions

#### For Your App (`streamlit_app.py`):

**Already Implemented:**
- Progress indicators during scans (keeps session alive)
- Status updates in real-time
- Proper error handling

**Additional Improvements to Add:**

```python
# Add at the top of streamlit_app.py
import streamlit as st

# Session state management to persist data
if 'last_scan_results' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.last_scan_results = None
if 'scan_in_progress' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.scan_in_progress = False

# Add periodic updates during long scans
# (This keeps the WebSocket connection alive)
```

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Fix Inactivity Issues

### Solution 1: Wake Up the App Regularly (Recommended)
If your app sleeps on Streamlit Cloud free tier:

1. **Use UptimeRobot or Similar Service (Free)**
   - Sign up at https://uptimerobot.com
   - Add your Streamlit app URL
   - Set to ping every 5 minutes
   - This keeps the app "warm" and prevents sleeping

2. **GitHub Actions Wake-Up Script**
   - Add a workflow that pings your app daily
   - Prevents the 7-day inactivity timeout

### Solution 2: Upgrade Streamlit Cloud Plan
- **Streamlit Community Cloud (Free)**: Apps sleep after inactivity
- **Streamlit for Teams ($250/month)**: Apps stay active 24/7

### Solution 3: Self-Host the App
Deploy on platforms that don't sleep:
- **Heroku** (with worker dyno)
- **Railway** (Hobby plan)
- **DigitalOcean App Platform**
- **AWS/Google Cloud** (more expensive)
- **Your own server** (VPS)

## üîß Quick Fixes for Common Issues

### Issue: App Says "This app has gone to sleep"
**Cause:** No visitors for 7 days on Streamlit Cloud free tier

**Solutions:**
1. Click "Wake up" button - instant fix
2. Set up UptimeRobot to ping every 5-10 minutes
3. Visit the app at least once per week
4. Upgrade to paid plan

### Issue: App Freezes During Long Scans
**Cause:** No progress updates, browser thinks it's frozen

**Solution:** 
- Already implemented: Progress bars and live metrics
- Reduce scan depth/concurrency for faster completion
- Enable "Quiet mode" to reduce console output

### Issue: "WebSocket connection closed"
**Cause:** Network interruption or browser tab inactive

**Solutions:**
1. Refresh the browser page
2. Check your internet connection
3. Clear browser cache
4. Try a different browser
5. Disable browser extensions that might block WebSockets

### Issue: Session State Lost
**Cause:** App restarted or session timeout

**Solution:**
```python
# Already using session state for results
# Users can download results as JSON/CSV before closing
```

## üéØ Recommended Setup for Production

### For Free Streamlit Cloud:
1. ‚úÖ Deploy your app
2. ‚úÖ Set up UptimeRobot monitoring (free)
3. ‚úÖ Configure `.streamlit/config.toml` (done)
4. ‚úÖ Add social sharing to increase traffic
5. ‚úÖ Enable analytics to track usage

### For Paid/Self-Hosted:
1. Use a proper hosting platform
2. Configure auto-scaling
3. Set up proper logging and monitoring
4. Use a CDN for faster global access
5. Implement user authentication if needed

## üìä UptimeRobot Setup (Step-by-Step)

1. **Create Account**
   - Go to https://uptimerobot.com
   - Sign up for free account
   - Confirm email

2. **Add Monitor**
   - Click "+ Add New Monitor"
   - Monitor Type: HTTP(s)
   - Friendly Name: "SQLi Scanner App"
   - URL: `https://yourapp.streamlit.app`
   - Monitoring Interval: 5 minutes
   - Click "Create Monitor"

3. **Verify**
   - Monitor should show "Up"
   - Receives a ping every 5 minutes
   - Keeps your app warm 24/7

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Free forever (up to 50 monitors)
- ‚úÖ Prevents app from sleeping
- ‚úÖ Email alerts if app goes down
- ‚úÖ Uptime statistics

## üöÄ GitHub Actions Wake-Up (Alternative)

Create `.github/workflows/keep-alive.yml`:

```yaml
name: Keep Streamlit App Alive

on:
  schedule:
    # Runs every day at 8 AM UTC
    - cron: '0 8 * * *'
  workflow_dispatch: # Manual trigger

jobs:
  wake-app:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Ping Streamlit App
        run: |
          curl -I https://yourapp.streamlit.app
          echo "App pinged successfully"
```

## üîê Security Considerations

When using external monitors:
- ‚úÖ UptimeRobot only pings public URLs (safe)
- ‚úÖ No sensitive data transmitted
- ‚úÖ App remains publicly accessible
- ‚ö†Ô∏è If you add authentication later, configure monitors accordingly

## üì± Mobile/Offline Issues

### Problem: App inactive on mobile
**Solution:**
- Keep browser tab active
- Disable battery optimization for browser
- Use desktop site mode in mobile browser

### Problem: Lost results when phone locks
**Solution:**
- Download results immediately (JSON/CSV)
- Use session state (already implemented)
- Re-run scan if needed (it's fast)

## ‚úÖ Checklist for Preventing Inactivity

- [x] Created `.streamlit/config.toml` configuration
- [ ] Set up UptimeRobot monitoring (or similar)
- [ ] Test app stays active after setup
- [ ] Document the app URL and wake-up process
- [ ] Configure email alerts for downtime
- [ ] Add wake-up instructions to README

## üéì Best Practices

1. **Regular Updates**: Push code updates monthly to reset inactivity timer
2. **Analytics**: Monitor usage with Streamlit analytics
3. **Communication**: Add a notice about potential sleep time
4. **Downloads**: Encourage users to download results
5. **Caching**: Use `@st.cache_data` for expensive operations (already used)

## üìû Getting Help

If issues persist:
1. Check [Streamlit Community Forum](https://discuss.streamlit.io)
2. Review [Streamlit Docs](https://docs.streamlit.io)
3. Open an issue on your GitHub repository
4. Contact Streamlit support (for paid plans)

---

**Summary:** The app becoming inactive is normal for free Streamlit Cloud apps. Use UptimeRobot (free) to keep it alive 24/7, or upgrade to a paid plan for guaranteed uptime.
